## Intro to Databases Project (CS-UY 3083) | Professor Ratan Dey

This is a web application for an online Air Ticket Reservation sytem.

We worked in a group of three and built the front-end, back-end, and database all by ourselves.

To run this program, please first go to the directory and then type in your terminal:

```
python staff.py
```

You will then be instructed to follow the link:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

In order to learn the use cases, functionalities, and the explanation for the backend and SQL queries, please refer to the folder:
```
"UseCases-README"
```
